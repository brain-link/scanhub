# Orchestration Engine

The **Orchestration Engine** is a service built on [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) that manages computational task execution within the Brain-Link platform.  

It coordinates and executes directed acyclic graph (DAG)â€“based jobs (e.g. calibration, image reconstruction, image processing, etc.). In ScanHub these DAG-based jobs are defined by `DAGTask` which integrate with the `AcquisitionTasks` that are executed by the device-manager and provide the data for the `DAGTask`.
