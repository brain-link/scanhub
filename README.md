About
-----

ScanHub is intended to be a multi modal acquisition software, which allows individualizable, modular and cloud-based processing of functional and anatomical medical images. 
It seamlessly merges the acquisition with the processing of complex data on a single platform.
ScanHub is open-source and freely availably to anyone :earth_africa:.

The greatest novalty of ScanHub is the cross-manufacturer and multi-modality aspect, allowing accessible cloud-based data processing in one framework :rocket:

Currently we are focussing on the development of an acquisition solution for the open-source MRI [OSI2One](https://www.opensourceimaging.org/2023/01/09/first-open-source-mri-scanner-presented-the-osii-one/).

This project only provides the user interface to interact with ScanHub. 
Check out the backbone of our acquisition platform :arrow_right: [ScanHub](https://github.com/brain-link/scanhub).

We welcome anyone who would like to join our mission, just [get in touch](mailto:info@brain-link.de) :email:.


Demo :clapper:
--------------

The following video shows a short demonstration of the ScanHub UI (September 2023). You will see how to navigate through the acquisition planner, inspect an MRI sequence and start an MRI simulation on a virtual MRI scanner. In the end we are demonstrating how to view the DICOM image, reconstructed by our workflow engine subsequently to the acquisition.

Installation
------------

To install the package, you need install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) first. 
The installation of ScanHub-UI is as simple as using the following command.

    docker-compose up -d --build
    
Note that you need to install [ScanHub](https://github.com/brain-link/scanhub), which is the backbone of the user interface.
Documentation on the installation of scanhub can be found in the README file.

Structural Overview
-------------------

The repository structures in two major components: the patient manager and the user interface. The patient-manager is suppose to emulate a simplified clinical patient management system. This part of the software might be replaced during setup in a (clinical) research facility. To provide a clean separation between data and patient, the patient manager is location here and is not part of the ScanHub backbone.

The frontend contains a `src/` directory which is structured as follows.

* views: All "main" views filling the whole browser window. This components are only included in the router file.
  * dashboard
  * patient-list/patient-table
  * device-list/device-table
  * patient-index
* components: Sub-components for views, if a view is more complex, sub-components might be gathered in a sub-folder. Components can be accessed from different views or also from other components.
* interfaces: Interface files contain ".interface" in front of the file ending ".tsx"
  * data.interface: Interfaces of all data objects like patient, device, workflow, etc.
  * component.interface: Component property interfaces
* client: (Global) Definition of the query client.
  * abstract-query-client: Template
  * urls: Base urls for data queries
  * queries: Constructions of all data query services
  * healthcheck: Queries to health endpoints
* utils: Contains general helper functions and global variables which can be shared between components/views.


The frontend application is written in react-typescript. The UI/UX is designed with MUI. We aim to build the application solely based on [MUI Joy-UI](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/overview/) and limit ourselves to using material ui in exceptions where there is not yet a solution with joy ui.

ScanHub-UI implements the following routes using the react-router-dom package (see `Routes.tsx`):

* patients
  * /patient-id/exam-id/procedure-id
* devices
* _workflows_
* dashboard/home

Database queries are performed using axios and an abstract-query-client implementation. The query clients can be found in the client directory.
