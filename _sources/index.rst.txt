#####################

Welcome to the online documentation of ScanHub, an open-source multimodal platform dedicated to rethink the workflows of medical imaging. Focusing prominently on MRI technology, ScanHub addresses the nuanced challenges of image acquisition, processing, and sharing by seamlessly integrating cloud-based solutions.

Developed in response to the pervasive challenges in traditional MRI infrastructure, such as scalability, cost-efficiency, and collaborative limitations, ScanHub emerges as a pioneering solution, ensuring the management and utilization of MRI data. By relocating image reconstruction and storage to the cloud, it not only curtails associated costs but also enhances scalability and collaboration across various spectrums of MRI research and clinical applications.
