Overview of the System
======================

The A4IM scanner is an innovative low-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) device, specifically designed for high-quality imaging of the human brain and extremities. Utilizing permanent magnets, the A4IM scanner distinguishes itself from traditional high-field MRI systems that use superconducting magnets. This low-field approach allows for a more compact design and reduced operational costs while still providing detailed images. The system is intended for use in healthcare facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centers.

The A4IM scanner comprises several key components that work in harmony to deliver high-resolution imaging capabilities:

Permanent Magnets: Provide the B0 magnetic field required for imaging, offering a compact and cost-effective solution compared to superconducting magnets.

Radiofrequency (RF) Coils: Essential for both transmitting and receiving signals necessary to generate images, these coils are designed for optimal sensitivity and image quality.

Gradient Coils: Responsible for spatial encoding of the MRI signals, these coils allow for precise image localization and resolution, which is crucial for accurate diagnostics.

Patient Table: Designed with patient comfort and safety in mind, the table ensures optimal positioning during scans.

MRI Console: This component houses the computer system and reference cards essential for controlling the MRI hardware and managing the acquisition process. It serves as the central hub for system operation.

MRI SanHub Software (Cloud-based): A cutting-edge platform that provides advanced image reconstruction and review capabilities. This software seamlessly integrates with the MRI console, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience.
